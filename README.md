# EVALUATION-OF-IR-MODELS
The goal of this project is to implement various IR models, evaluate the IR system and improve the search results based on our understanding of the models, the implementation and the evaluation. The three IR models to be implemented are
1. Best matching 25 (BM25) model
2. Divergence From Randomness (DFR) model 3. Language Model
Input data is twitter data in three languages: English, German and Russian which is to be indexed using Solr and the results are evaluated using the trec_eval program. Based on these results we have to improve the Mean Average Precision (MAP) results.
